at first i struggled with this project. 
i was able to get everything to work individually but then piecing it together as whole proved difficult.
at the end of the day i took Tims advice and and refrenced the homework more.
I did not complete the gif pause and play portion of this. I started fiddling with the code but never compelted it.
